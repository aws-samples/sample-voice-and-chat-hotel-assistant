# Virtual Assistant Chatbot - Demo website

This demo application provides a user interface for the Virtual Assistant
Chatbot.

## Getting started

You will need the `ConfigurationBucket` and `UserPool` Outputs of stack
deployment.

For the demo, user sign up is disabled. You will need to
[create your user on the Amazon Cognito console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html#creating-a-new-user-using-the-console)
in the `UserPool` so you can log in.

1. Navigate to the Amazon Cognito console.
2. Find your User Pool using the `UserPoolId` from the stack deployment outputs.
3. In the "Users" section, click "Create user" and follow the instructions.

To run this frontend locally while developing you must first download the
`runtime-config.json` from the configuration bucket and copy it to the `public`
folder of the website.

```shell
cd packages/website
aws s3 cp s3://<ConfigurationBucket>/frontend/runtime-config.json public/runtime-config.json
```

Then you can start the website by running

```shell
nx serve @virtual-assistant/demo
```
